simple recursive descent parser and interpreter of a subset of pascal.

Thanks to a great guide here: https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part7/


```bash
g++ main.cpp
./a.out examples/part_10_ast.pascal
```

# TODO
* For some reason a semicolon gets added as a symbol. Fix that.
* Continue to part 12 of the blog

# What I would have done differently
* `Node` shouldn't have an enum to determine what type of node it is. Instead it should
have different derived classes. This would also simplify the node visitor.
